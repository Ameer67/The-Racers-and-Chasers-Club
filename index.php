    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p>The Racers &amp; Chasers Club is a group of players who try to simulate 
    the experiences of a police officer or a street racer while staying true to the following core values:
    fun, realistic, and democratic. Forza Horizon 4 is where club sessions are hosted
    (which are typically held on Fridays and weekends). 
    Members are expected to join sessions approximately once
    every two weeks or as much as possible. Take a look around the site and <a href="members.php">sign up</a> once you're ready!</p>

            <p>There are two sides participating in our sessions: the cops and the racers. Members are given the oppurtunity to wreak havoc as a criminal or enforce the laws with other officers.</p>
