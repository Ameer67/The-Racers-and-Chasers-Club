                <h4>How it works</h4>
                <p>One person is assigned to be a racer, and everyone else is a cop. (If there are 8+ players, two racers are allowed simultaneously.) See the <a href="police.php">"Catching the criminals"</a> section to see how pursuits work and when a racer is considered busted. Once a racer's turn is up, someone else is allowed to take their spot and the previous racer must switch to a cop. </p>
