        <h3>Catching the criminals</h3>
        <p>The goal of the LPS is to bust racers as fast and as safely as possible. This is done using a variety of maneuvers and tactics. The stages of a pursuit are listed below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>PATROLLING</li>
            <p>All on-duty police officers will be on the lookout for anyone causing trouble. Things like going above the speed limit, causing damage, driving like a drunkard, etc. will attract the police to a racer. This is the only time a police officer can change/tune their vehicle. Police are not allowed to continually follow a racer around unless they are doing something suspiscous.</p>
            <li><h4>INITIATING THE PURSUIT</h4></li>
            <p>Once the officer sees an offender, they will attempt to pull them over by driving behind their vehicle and honking their horn a few times. Officers should give racers a few seconds to pull over before starting a chase.</p>
        </ol>
