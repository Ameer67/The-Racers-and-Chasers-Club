            <h3>Catching the criminals</h3>
            <p>The goal of the LPS is to bust racers as fast and as safely as possible. This is done using a variety of maneuvers and tactics. The stages of a pursuit are listed below.</p>

                <h4>1. Patrolling</h4>
                <p>All on-duty police officers will be on the lookout for anyone causing trouble. Things like going above the speed limit, causing damage, driving like a drunkard, etc. will attract the police to a racer. Police are not allowed to continually follow a racer around unless they are doing something suspiscous.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>2. Initiating the pursuit</h4>
                <p>Once the officer sees an offender, they will attempt to pull them over by driving behind their vehicle and honking their horn a few times. Officers should give racers a few seconds to pull over before starting a chase.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>3. Chasing the racer</h4>
                <p>To bust a racer, the police must surrond the him/her for 10 seconds. If the pursuit lasted 10 or more minutes and/or the SWAT team was called in, the racer's car is impounded. Otherwise, the racer gets a second try. The second try (if there is one) will always result in an impound at the end.</p>

                <h4>4. Busting the racer or calling of the pursuit</h4>
                <p>To bust a racer, the police must surrond the him/her for 10 seconds. If the pursuit lasted 10 or more minutes and/or the SWAT team was called in, the racer's car is impounded. Otherwise, the racer gets a second try. The second try (if there is one) will always result in an impound at the end.</p>
