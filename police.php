    <p>Formed in 2018, the new Lothian Police Service protects the Lothian region and surrounding communities from the recent surge in illegal street racing. Anyone with information about any suspicious activies should contact the LPS immediately.</p>

                <h3>Catching the criminals</h3>
                <p>The goal of the LPS is to bust racers as fast and as safely as possible. This is done using a variety of maneuvers and tactics. The stages of a pursuit are listed below.</p>

                <h4>1. Patrolling</h4>
                <p>All on-duty police officers will be on the lookout for anyone causing trouble. Police are not allowed to continually follow anyone around unless they are doing something suspiscous.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>2. Initiating the pursuit</h4>
                <p>Once the officer sees an offender, they will attempt to pull them over by driving behind their vehicle and honking their horn/siren a few times. Officers should give racers a few seconds to pull over before starting a chase.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>3. Chasing the racer</h4>
                <p>If the offender does not stop their vehicle, the officer and offender are now in a pursuit. Whatever is needed to bust the racer will be done.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>4A. Busting the racer</h4>
                <p>Police must surround the racer for at least 10 seconds to be considered caught. If police lose visual contact for 2 minutes, the racer has successfully evaded.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>5A. Racer first try bust</h4>
                <p> If the chase lasted 10+ minutes, reached priority 1, and/or the SWAT team was called in, racers do NOT get a second try. Otherwise, move to 5B.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>5B. Racer second try bust (if applicable)</h4>
                <p>The racer's turn is up, regardless of whether or not the conditions previously stated were met.</p>

                <h3>Pursuit priorities</h3>
                <p>Police pursuits are split into three categories depending on the status of the chase. The lead officer can help inform others by declaring the priority.</p>

                <h4>Priority 3</h4>
                <p>The pursuit (if there is one) is under control and hasn't escalated. Backup is not needed at the moment. <br>Example: typical traffic stop.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Priority 2</h4>
                <p>The pursuit is starting to escalate and things are getting a bit out of hand. Some backup would be useful. <br>Example: runaway speeder.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Priority 1</h4>
                <p>The pursuit is completely out of control and all backup available should join the chase. <br> Example: pursuit that has been going on for a while.</p>
