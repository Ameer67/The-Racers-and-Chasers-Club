                <h3>Catching the criminals</h3>
                <p>The goal of the LPS is to bust racers as fast and as safely as possible. This is done using a variety of maneuvers and tactics. The stages of a pursuit are listed below. Everyone in the session should have at least one attempt at being a racer.</p>

                <h4>1. Patrolling</h4>
                <p>All on-duty police officers will be on the lookout for anyone causing trouble. Police are not allowed to continually follow anyone around unless they are doing something suspiscous.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>2. Initiating the pursuit</h4>
                <p>Once the officer sees an offender, they will attempt to pull them over by driving behind their vehicle and honking their horn/siren a few times. Officers should give racers a few seconds to pull over before starting a chase.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>3. Chasing the racer</h4>
                <p>If the offender does not stop their vehicle, the officer and offender are now in a pursuit. Whatever is needed to bust the racer will be done.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>4A. Busting the racer</h4>
                <p>Police must surround the racer for at least 10 seconds to be considered caught. If police lose visual contact for 2 minutes, the racer has successfully evaded.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>5A. Racer first try bust</h4>
                <p> If the chase lasted 10+ minutes, reached priority 1, and/or the SWAT team was called in, racers do NOT get a second try. Otherwise, move to 5B.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>5B. Racer second try bust (if applicable)</h4>
                <p>The racer's turn is up, regardless of whether or not the conditions previously stated were met.</p>

                <h3>Pursuit priorities</h3>
                <p>Police pursuits are split into three categories depending on the status of the chase. The lead officer can help inform others by declaring the priority.</p>

                <h4>Priority 3</h4>
                <p>The pursuit (if there is one) is under control and hasn't escalated. Backup is not needed at the moment. <br>Example: typical traffic stop.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Priority 2</h4>
                <p>The pursuit is starting to escalate and things are getting a bit out of hand. Some backup would be useful. <br>Example: runaway speeder.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Priority 1</h4>
                <p>The pursuit is completely out of control and all backup available should join the chase. <br> Example: pursuit that has been going on for a while.</p>
