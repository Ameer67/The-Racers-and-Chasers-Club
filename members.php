                <h4>2. Initiating the pursuit</h4>
                <p>Once the officer sees an offender, they will attempt to pull them over by driving behind their vehicle and honking their horn/siren a few times. Officers should give racers a few seconds to pull over before starting a chase.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>3. Chasing the racer</h4>
                <p>If the offender does not stop their vehicle, the officer and offender are now in a pursuit. Whatever is needed to bust the racer will be done.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>4A. Busting the racer</h4>
                <p>Police must surround the racer for at least 10 seconds to be considered caught. If police lose visual contact for 2 minutes, the racer has successfully evaded.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>4B. Racer first try bust</h4>
                <p> If the chase lasted 10+ minutes, reached priority 1, and/or the SWAT team was called in, racers do NOT get a second try. Otherwise, move to 4C.</p>

                <h4>4C. Racer second try bust (if applicable)</h4>
